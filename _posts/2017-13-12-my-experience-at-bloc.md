title: My Experience at Bloc
---
Hello. 

I've had a long journey during my time at Bloc. When I started Bloc earlier this year, I only had the slightest clue what coding entailed. I dabbled with HTML during my time as a teen on Myspace, and missed with CSS here and there but I never really knew what went into it. 

I had the intention of learning what it takes to become a Frontend Developer. It was exciting to start a new chapter in my life. HTML and CSS wasn’t too hard to get a grip on, but I had one major thorn in my side a couple weeks in. 

Learning the ins and outs of Javascript was proving to be a challenge. At first it was grasping loops. I knew what they did what was the purpose of them. What was throwing me for a (no pun intended) loop was the math part of it.

You see, math was never been my strong suit in twenty seven years of living. At first, it was figuring out where ‘less than’ and ‘greater than’ went in the loops, how arrays factored into all of this and where to actually put the loop.

Maybe some of this was on me because I was expecting a little bit more hands-on learning from the program. My mentor, Mike, was great at this. He helped me along the way. I wished some of the earlier checkpoints had in-depth lessons from Bloc and not a third party resource.

But alas, here I am. Eventually the curriculum changed and Bloc started to offer more in-depth checkpoints.

Unfortunately, I hit a wall due to getting a new job and some other things going in my personal life, and my progress had come to a screeching halt. I’m still trying to get my rhythm back, but it is proving to be difficult. 

My program is due to end in a couple weeks. I’ve come too far in my studies to let it end like this. I still fully intend to finish the program. It may take longer to get to my goal, but I will prevail.
